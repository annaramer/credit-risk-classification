# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview
- This analysis aims to develop a predictive model for assessing loan risk using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on various borrower attributes.
