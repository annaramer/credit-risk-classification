# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview
This analysis aims to develop a logistic regression model for credit risk assessment using historical lending data. The goal is to assist lending institutions in identifying and managing credit risk effectively, thereby optimizing lending practices and minimizing potential losses from loan defaults.

## Summary
- The logistic regression model demonstrates strong performance in credit risk assessment, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores for both healthy and high-risk loans. With an accuracy of 99% on both training and testing datasets, the model accurately classifies loans and effectively identifies potential high-risk borrowers.

- The high precision scores indicate the model's ability to correctly identify the majority of healthy and high-risk loans among its predictions. Similarly, the high recall scores suggest effective capturing of most actual instances of both healthy and high-risk loans.

- Deploying the logistic regression model can significantly improve lending decision-making processes, allowing institutions to better manage credit risk and optimize loan portfolios. Continuous monitoring and refinement are necessary to ensure the model's ongoing effectiveness and adaptability to changing market conditions and borrower behaviors.
